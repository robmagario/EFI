My configuration

Asrock B365M Pro4
Radeon Sapphire RX580 graphics card


In order to make the hardware acceleration work on the graphics card, I used the MacPro7,1 profile.
I have tried with iMac19,1 before but it doesn't work with hardware acceleration, so I have since changed to MacPro7,1 and it works 100%.

What works
- hardware acceleration. I have tested it with VideoProC.
- most USB ports works. At the least the ones I need to use, including the USB Type-C port.

What doesn't work
- WiFi doesn't work but I installed a Fenvi card and it works well now.
